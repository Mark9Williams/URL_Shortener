# App Idea: URL Shortener a web-based Django app.
## Description: 
The URL Shortener app allows users to shorten long URLs into shorter, more
manageable links. Users can input a long URL, and the app generates a unique short URL that
redirects to the original long URL when accessed. The app should have a web-based user interface.
